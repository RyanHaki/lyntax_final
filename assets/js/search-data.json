So to solve this problem we had decided to start using LiveShare. LiveShare is an extension that people can use which can make a repository into something like a shared google doc and makes it where only the host has to commit which lessens the chance of merge conflicts. . Our progress . During week 1, we created an api that would be able to display a definition of a word which is unknown to the user. Along with this we created the framework for the letters and the hangman. We also finished with the backend part of the project . Our goals for the week . This weeks plan is to make each letter tangible, create a space where the unknown word would be shown, and create a space where the letters not included in the word and guesses by the user are placed. We also need the program look presentable for the user and to keep updating the word api. Finally make it so the hangman can “grow body parts. . Our commits . .",

            "content": "Hacks . Similarities . There are some similarities that I see with the Javascript in the Jokes API . They all have similar syntax with each other | All connect to the table made using HTML code | Use a lot of .json and .log | Use fetch a lot as well as if and else statements | Make use of functions to check and run things | Use onclick to run a function each time an action occurs | All do different things using the same API | . Breaking up the code for Covid API . The code below makes a table using HTML code and makes 4 columns titled Time, All-time Cases, Recorded Deaths, and Active Cases. It also makes an id for each row under those 4 columns with the id name the same as its column name. . &lt;!-- HTML table fragment for page --&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Time&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;All-time Cases&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Recorded Deaths&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Active Cases&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;td id=&quot;time&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td id=&quot;total_cases&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td id=&quot;total_deaths&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td id=&quot;active_cases&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; . The code below also uses HTML code to output a table with the same columns and titles as the code above. But, this one has a different id with the id name equal to &quot;result &quot;. . &lt;table&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Country&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;All-time Cases&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Recorded Deaths&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Active Cases&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody id=&quot;result&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- generated rows --&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; . The code below uses the link to the API to extract specific variables and then output them in the &quot;result &quot; section in the HTML table. It also makes headers. . &lt;!-- Script is layed out in a sequence (no function) and will execute when page is loaded --&gt; &lt;script&gt; // prepare HTML result container for new output const resultContainer = document.getElementById(&quot;result&quot;); // prepare fetch options const url = &quot;https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/covid/&quot;; const headers = { method: &#39;GET&#39;, // *GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. mode: &#39;cors&#39;, // no-cors, *cors, same-origin cache: &#39;default&#39;, // *default, no-cache, reload, force-cache, only-if-cached credentials: &#39;omit&#39;, // include, *same-origin, omit headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39; // &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&#39;, }, }; . The code below fetches the url and headers made in the segment of code presented above. The code checks for any response errors in those headers uding an if statement and if there is none, those elements are appended to the HTML table. The responses are also outputted using JSON data. . // fetch the API fetch(url, headers) // response is a RESTful &quot;promise&quot; on any successful fetch .then(response =&gt; { // check for response errors if (response.status !== 200) { const errorMsg = &#39;Database response error: &#39; + response.status; console.log(errorMsg); const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const td = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); td.innerHTML = errorMsg; tr.appendChild(td); resultContainer.appendChild(tr); return; } // valid response will have json data response.json().then(data =&gt; { console.log(data); console.log(data.world_total) . The code below gets all the data specific to the API such as World Data, Country Data, and then are appended to the HTML table. This is achieved through the getElementById. They are appended to their respective row based on whater their data is about. The code also checks for fetch errors and then appends to the table again. . // World Data document.getElementById(&quot;time&quot;).innerHTML = data.world_total.statistic_taken_at; document.getElementById(&quot;total_cases&quot;).innerHTML = data.world_total.total_cases; document.getElementById(&quot;total_deaths&quot;).innerHTML = data.world_total.total_deaths; document.getElementById(&quot;active_cases&quot;).innerHTML = data.world_total.active_cases; // Country data for (const row of data.countries_stat) { console.log(row); // tr for each row const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); // td for each column const name = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const cases = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const deaths = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const active = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); // data is specific to the API name.innerHTML = row.country_name; cases.innerHTML = row.cases; deaths.innerHTML = row.deaths; active.innerHTML = row.active_cases; // this builds td&#39;s into tr tr.appendChild(name); tr.appendChild(cases); tr.appendChild(deaths); tr.appendChild(active); // add HTML to container resultContainer.appendChild(tr); } }) }) // catch fetch errors (ie ACCESS to server blocked) .catch(err =&gt; { console.error(err); const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const td = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); td.innerHTML = err; tr.appendChild(td); resultContainer.appendChild(tr); }); &lt;/script&gt; .",

Computers | Tablets | Servers | Routers | Smart sensors | . | A computer network is a type of computing system | A path between two computing devices on a computer network (a sender and a reciever) is a sequence of directly connected computing devices that begins at the sender and ends at the receiver. | Routing is the process of finding a path from sender to receiver. | The bandwidth of a computer network is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time. | Bandwidth is usually measured in bits per second. | . . How Computers Are Connected . A computing system is a group of computing devices and programs working together for a common purpose. | A computer network is a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data. | . . Packets . A packet is a small amount of data sent over a network. Each packet also includes the source and the destination information. | Packet Switching: The message (file) is broken up into packets and sent in any order. The packets are reassembled by the recipient’s device. Ex: Hello. How are you? ==&gt; | Hello. You? How are | . | . | . . The Internet . The Internet is a computer network consisting of interconnected networks that use standardized, open (nonpropritary) communication protocols. | Access to the Internet depends on the ability to connact a computing dvice to an internet connected device. | Routing on the Internet is usually dynamic; it is not specified in advance | Information is passed through the Internet as a data stream. Data streams contain chunks of data, which are encapsulated in packets | Packets contain a chunk of data and metadata used for routing the packet between the origin and the destination on the Internet, as well as for data reassembly | Packets may arrive at the destination in order, our of order, or not at all | The World Wide Web is a system of linked pages, programs, and files | The World Wide Web uses the Internet | . . Protocols . A protocol is an agreed-upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system. | The protocols used in the Internet are open, which allows users to easily connect additional computing devices to the Internet. | IP, TCP, and UDP are common protocols used on the Internet TCP does error checking and error recovery so it is slower | UDP performs error checking, but it discards erroneous packets | . | HTTP is a protocol used by the World Wide Web | . . Internet and Transport Layers . Transport Layer - How the packets are sent, and for what Reliability - reliable - sender gets a receipt back, resend as needed TCP | Unreliability - send and forget. UDP | . | Internet Layer IPv4: Example 192.168.24.1 32 bits, separated into 4 “octets” 8 bits long (0-255) | Separated into 2 parts: Network (1-31) | Device (32-network bits) | . | . | Three targets that can be addressed using IP Unicast - A specific device.

Like http but with security. Usually uses TCP Port 443 | . | Web Servers: Programs running on machines connected to the Internet | Provides clients web pages - data linked to other pages using URLs (Uniform Resource Locations) | Ex, https://www.mycompany.com | The World Wide Web (WWW) is this network of linked data and programs, running over the Internet | . | DNS - Domain Name Service Applications that translate a human readable URL (e.g. www.mycompany.com) to an IP address | DNS holds a database of mapping of names to IPs. Servers running DNS are spread across the internet | There are large computers serving and managing these name/IP Mappings for each Domain (.com, .net, .gov, etc.) | You use a DNS server every time you ask for a web page on a browser | . | . .

The scalability of a system is the capacity for the system to change in size and scale to meet new demands. | The Internet was designed to be scalable Able to change in size and scale to meet new demands | . | Local Area Network (LAN): Physical Connections | Limited by hardware and physics | 1 to 100s of systems | . | Intranet: LANs connected by Routers within an organization | . | Autonomous Systems (AS): Large intranets linked together under the control and policies of major organizations. Large routers link networks with large telecommunications connections | . | The Internet: Autonomous Systems linked together | Large Routers linking Ass via special telecom means (Fiber, T3, Satellites) | Major infrastructures - DNS (.com, .net, etc.), Cyber Operations | . | . . Authentication . Authentication measures protect devices and information from unauthorized access. Ex: Strong passwords | Multifactor authentication. | . | A strong passwrod is something that is easy for a user to remember, but would be difficult for someone else to guess based on knowledge of that user. | Multifactor authentication is a method of computer access control in which a user is only granted access after successfully presenting several separate pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism, typically in at least two of the following categories: knowledge (something they know) | possession (something they have) | ingerence (something they are) | . | Multifactor authentication requires a least two steps to unlock protected information; each step adds a new layer of security that must be broken to gain unauthorized access. | . . Encryption . Encryption: the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access | Decryption: the process of decoding the data. | Two common encryption approaches are: Symmetric key encryption involves one key for both encryption and decryption | Public key encryption pairs a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The sender does not need the receiver’s private key to encrypt a message, but the receiver’s private key is required to decrypt the message | . | . | Certificate authorities issue digital certificates that validates the ownership of encryption keys used in secure communications and are based on a trust model. | . . Viruses and Malware . Computer virus and malware scanning software can help protect a computing system against infection. | A computer virus is a malicious program that can copy itself and gain access to a computer in an unauthorized way. Computer viruses often attach themselves to legitimate programs and start running independently on a computer. | Malware is software intended to damage a computing system or to take partial control over its operation. Can infiltrate a system by posing as legitimate programs or by attaching itself to legitimate programs, like an email attachment | . | Virus scans can help to prevent malicious code from getting into and affecting your system | . . Prevention . All real-world systems have errors or design flaws that can be exploited to compromise them. Regular software updates help fix errors that could compromise a computing system. | Users can control the permissions programs they have for collecting user information. Users should review the permission settings of programs to protect their privacy. | . . Quiz Results . .",

            "content": "Main Ideas . Me and my Group have decided to code a program that will simulate a game of hangman. Hangman is a game between two or more players. One player known as the executioner thinks up of a word or a sentence and at least one other person needs to guess what that word or sentence might be going one letter at a time. If the guesser(s) guess a letter that is not in the phase, the executioner draws a body part of a stick figure onto a gallow. If the executioner draws all the body parts, the guessers lose and the game is over. If the guessers complete the phase, they win. The Purpose of this program is to teach and/or test the user&#39;s vocabulary skills. This is done through hangman by displaying a definition of the unknown word or by displaying a topic that relates to the unknown sentence. They must have good vocabalury skills to win the game as well as good grammer. The Project will have an impact on the coders and the users. It will impact the coders because it will provide them with knowledge and experince about code. It will impact the users because it should be able to enhance their vocabulary and some rules about grammer and words . Program, Purpose, and Function: The purpose of this program is to test the user&#39;s vocabulary skills. This is done through hangman by displaying a definition of the unknown word or by displaying a topic that relates to the unknown sentence. The users must have good vocabalury skills to win the game as well as good grammer . | Data Abstraction: The program will need to have lists, dictionaries, and an API. Mostly likely, the lists and dictionaries will be located inside an API. This API will have the definitions and words that will be used for hangman. My group will use the API and code around it so that the user can guess the word in a style that simulates hangman. . | Managing Complexity: The API is what is being coded around so that will organize the code. However, this only displays what to display. My group will need to program the functions of the inputs and outputs. This will still be connected to the API. . | Procedural Abstraction: There will be a function in the program that determines if the inputed word and the unknown word and the same. This is important to the rest of the program because this will display that the game is over and the code can end or move on to a different segment of the code. This line of code gives the other code segments purpose. . | Algorithm Implementation: The program have a API and code in the program will loop the APi in order to gain more words and definitions and display them. More will be explained once the code segment is actually created. . | Testing: The main call used in the hangman program would be the event when the user inputs a word. When the user puts in a word, a function will check if it matched with the unknown word. If they do not, the user guesses again and calls the same function from earlier. . |",

Menu burger $3.99 fries $1.99 drink $0.99 checkout $0 Please slelect an item. Then once your finished with the order type &#39;break&#39; Total is: $12.96 . Some Common Errors . No one is perfect. Errors are bound to happen but identifying, understanding, and fixing thoses errors is what matters more. There are 4 main types of errors when developing a program. These are Logic, Syntax, run-time, and overflow errors. . Over-flow errors occur in a program when it is required to perform a calculation that is not possible for it to run. The values in the calculations are outside the set range of values of the program. This is caused due to memory allocation constraints of the program&#39;s language, resulting in restrictions. . | Run-time errors happen when a program stops while it is running. This event is also known as &quot;crashing &quot; and the error is normally referred to as a &quot;bug &quot;. A run-time error can be caused by dividing by zero, wrong inputed data type, or many other errors that are commonly caused by incorrect data . | Syntax errors are very small mistakes made by the programmer that doesn&#39;t match with the language. It could be a typo, unnecessary code, missing necessary code, missing characters or added characters. Characters include colon, semicolon, parenthesis, indentations, quotes, and so much more. These mistakes will cause the program to shut down. . | Logic errors are errors that are caused due to the programmer making a mistake in the algorithm. This causes the program to behave unexpectedly. A logic error can result in events in the program taking place in times that they are not suppose to happen in. . | . How To correct Errors . Extra Outputs: Lastly, a programmer could just add extra outputs. This strategy is used so that the programmer could find where the error is in the program. When the error is fixed, the extra output is normally removed. . | Hand Tracing: Another testing strategy is hand tracing. Hand tracing is putting in values of variables in a loop to find out if the outcome is correct. This is most useful with loops and other small code segments that repeat a number of times. . | IDEs: Syntax errors are the easiest errors to fix because most IDEs display information on where and when there is a syntax error. . | Test Cases: Unlike syntax errors, logic errors are more difficult to found because the IDEs doesn&#39;t help you and it would normally look like nothing is wrong. This is when programmers use test cases. Test cases are a set of actions(like inputs) that are used to check if they get the correct result. . | . Testing a Program . Programmers are planning program tests at the beginning of development. They determine the program&#39;s specifications and inputs and ask themselves how will they know if the program is working correctly. The Defined inputs used to test the program demonstrate different outcomes that would be expected, no matter if it works or not. When the inputs and outputs are matched, the programers test the code. After the test, programmers use the infomation that the program give them and revise, refine, and/or improve their work. Then they test again, make more changes, test again, and again. Once the programmers made clear results that they wanted, they let users test it and make more changes from that. After all that, the program is finished and can be released but even still, most of the time they will still be changes that must be fixed. . Hacks: Test Planning . What errors may arise in your project? . In program development, many errors eccour but most of them are small. These small errors could be an incorrect line of code, a typo, or a missed character. Most errors are like this but sometimes the error is bigger. Entire procedures can have the wrong purpose, code is typed using an incorrect language, program is set up incorrectly, and code could be blocked to some members of the team. All of these errors can break the entire code so ALL ERRORS MUST BE FIXED in our code. | . | What are some test cases that can be used? . The desried inputs for my team&#39;s program would be english words but we must test more than that. Test cases that can be used would include any word from any language with any amount of letters as well as numbers or other special characters. This would mostly likely break the code and that is why my group must test them. It would be the best way to fix them. | . | .",

            "content": "Collegeboard Notes . Essential Knowledge . A development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature | There are multiple development processes. The following phrases are commonly used when developing a program: Investigating and refleting | Designing | Prototyping | Testing | . | A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phrases of the process. | A development proess that is incremental is one that breaks the problem into smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole. | The design of a program incorporates investigation to determine its requirements. | Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraints, as well as the concerns and interests of the people who will use the program. | Some ways investigation can be performed are as follows: Collecting data through surveys | User testing | Inteviews | Direct observations | . | Program requirements describes how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide | . . How is a Program Developed? . Rarely a solo endeavor . Usually developed by teams of people It all starts with an idea | Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind | Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan | Sometimes the development is more exploratory than anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens (both good and bad) Think about early AI projects, like personal assistants Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect | . | Investigation is an important step in the process | Developers must: Determine the requirements of the program | Understand the constraints | Understand the user concerns and interests | . | How do developers investigate? Surveys | User testing | Interviews | Direct observations After initial investigation and reflection, | . | Developers design the program by Brainstorming (draw on investigation) | Storyboarding the program | Planning user experience | Laying out the user interface | Organizing into modules | Develop a testing strategy | . | Developers decide on the program requirements that Describe how a program should behave | Include a list of user interactions | . | The program specifications outline all of the requirements | Developers create a prototype of the program (or components): An incremental process is frequently used so developers can refine small parts (modules) of the program Testing, testing, and more testing! | . | Developers test the program every step of the way | Testing occurs at the Micro level | Macro level | . | Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection | . . When does documentation happen? . Documentation happens throughout the development of the program: . At the beginning: list specifications | During: to keep track of process | After: to explain the overall process Documentation throughout can improve: | Efficiency of overall programming process | Programmers’ ability to test and refine the program | Programmers’ response to bugs | . . Collegeboard quiz results . This is the screenshot of the results of the quiz I took on Collegeboard . . . Final Project Design . Idea/Brain Write . A random quiz generator. Save notes in the website and the alogrithm uses the notes to genrate questions for a quiz. The quiz is then scored and the topics missed are highlighted. Me and my team reviewed over the different possible final project ideas that we made and this is the best one we came up with. . . Outline and how it fits requirements . Program Purpose and Function -The purpose of the program is to randomly generate vocabulary words based on a defenition. The program will take the user’s notes and, based on it, select the key terms and a hangman type game where it gives you a definition and you have to guess word based off it. . Data Abstraction . The program will contain lists and dictionaries. Every key term will have a definition and these will be stored in a dictionary which will be stored in a list. Or they will be stored in a local database and we will use the objects in the database to create the hangman quiz. | . Managing Complexity . The dictionaries and databases will manage the complexity of the program by organizing the data inputted by the user. It will also help calling back to creating the hangman quiz. | . Procedural Abstraction . A function will be created to call back to the data inputted by the user. The function will iterate over the dictionary/database and use the values in them as a parameter to make a hangman quiz. | . Algorithm Implementation . Like stated before, the program will contain a function that uses iteration and sequencing to make a hangman quiz based off the data inputted by the user that is saved in a database or dictionary. | . Testing . The function will be called each time the user inputs a note and each time the user generates a hangman quiz. When the user inputs a note, the function is called and saves the note inside a dictionary or database. When the user presses the button that generates the hangman quiz, the function is again called and iterates through the user’s notes to generate a hangman quiz that is related to the key terms the user inputted. | . .",

Challenges I faced . I have done block coding in the past with websites like scratch so I knew generally how it worked. But still I faced a challenge. This was being getting the result screen to work properly since I wanted different types of text to show depending on your score. First what would happen was your score would show but all the different text would pop up. So I fixed this with the if/else block and it that fixed my orginal problem of the all the text popping out at once. But this led to the score always showing up as 100% even if you got everything wrong so I added the setText block with the if/else block. . What can I do to improve my quiz . Some things I would like to add is to randomize the order of my questions so its not always the same order. I also want to add sound effects to my quiz to improve the user experience. Finally something that I want to improve on for my quiz is to make the code much more efficent. .",

For Loops and Index . Using for loops and iterating through using index in python. Here is a simple example: . Food = [&quot;Burger&quot;, &quot;Hot Dog&quot;, &quot;Fries&quot;, &quot;Pizza&quot;, &quot;Goldfish&quot;, &quot;Donut&quot;, &quot;M&amp;M&quot;, &quot;Beef Kebab&quot;, &quot;Chicken Kebab&quot;, &quot;Burrito&quot;, &quot;Tacos&quot;, &quot;Chicken Sandwich&quot;] for i in Food: print(i) . Burger Hot Dog Fries Pizza Goldfish Donut M&amp;M Beef Kebab Chicken Kebab Burrito Tacos Chicken Sandwich . Outputting in Reverse Order . It is possible to output data in a reverse order. Here is an example using a palindrome: . def is_palindrome(prompt): print(prompt[::-1]) print(prompt) return prompt[::-1] == prompt word = input(&quot;Enter a word: &quot;) if is_palindrome(word.lower()) is True: print(&quot;{0} is a palindrome!&quot;.format(word)) else: print(&quot;The provided word is not a palindrome.&quot;) . olleh hello The provided word is not a palindrome. . Other list methods . Lists can have a variety of methods performed on them. A couple being .append() or while loop. Here is an example using .append() and .lower() with a for loop: . Dangerous_Animals = [&quot;Box Jellyfish&quot;, &quot;African CAPE BuFfalo&quot;, &quot;BLAck MambA&quot;, &quot;Blue-RINGED octopus&quot;] Dangerous_Animals.append(&quot;Cone SnAIl&quot;) for i in range(len(Dangerous_Animals)): Dangerous_Animals[i] = Dangerous_Animals[i].lower() print(Dangerous_Animals) . [&#39;box jellyfish&#39;, &#39;african cape buffalo&#39;, &#39;black mamba&#39;, &#39;blue-ringed octopus&#39;, &#39;cone snail&#39;] . Adding to a Dictionary . You can also add or create new keys and values to a dictionary data set. This can also be done with input. Here is an example: . My_Dict = { &quot;Absence&quot;: &quot;The lack or unavailability of something or someone.&quot;, &quot;Approval&quot;: &quot;Having a positive opinion of something or someone.&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;The response or receipt to a phone call, question, or letter.&quot;, &quot;Attention&quot;: &quot;Noticing or recognizing something of interest.&quot;, &quot;Amount&quot;: &quot;A mass or a collection of something.&quot;, &quot;Borrow&quot;: &quot;To take something with the intention of returning it after a period of time.&quot;, &quot;Baffle&quot;: &quot;An event or thing that is a mystery and confuses.&quot;, &quot;Ban&quot;: &quot;An act that is prohibited by social pressure or law.&quot;, &quot;Cars&quot;: &quot;Four-wheeled vehicles used for traveling.&quot;, } print(My_Dict) My_Dict[&quot;Care&quot;] = &quot;extra responsibility and attention.&quot; #Added new key and value into dictionary print(My_Dict) My_Dict[&quot;Chip&quot;] = input() # Added new value with input print(My_Dict) . {&#39;Absence&#39;: &#39;The lack or unavailability of something or someone.&#39;, &#39;Approval&#39;: &#39;Having a positive opinion of something or someone.&#39;, &#39;Answer&#39;: &#39;The response or receipt to a phone call, question, or letter.&#39;, &#39;Attention&#39;: &#39;Noticing or recognizing something of interest.&#39;, &#39;Amount&#39;: &#39;A mass or a collection of something.&#39;, &#39;Borrow&#39;: &#39;To take something with the intention of returning it after a period of time.&#39;, &#39;Baffle&#39;: &#39;An event or thing that is a mystery and confuses.&#39;, &#39;Ban&#39;: &#39;An act that is prohibited by social pressure or law.&#39;, &#39;Cars&#39;: &#39;Four-wheeled vehicles used for traveling.&#39;} {&#39;Absence&#39;: &#39;The lack or unavailability of something or someone.&#39;, &#39;Approval&#39;: &#39;Having a positive opinion of something or someone.&#39;, &#39;Answer&#39;: &#39;The response or receipt to a phone call, question, or letter.&#39;, &#39;Attention&#39;: &#39;Noticing or recognizing something of interest.&#39;, &#39;Amount&#39;: &#39;A mass or a collection of something.&#39;, &#39;Borrow&#39;: &#39;To take something with the intention of returning it after a period of time.&#39;, &#39;Baffle&#39;: &#39;An event or thing that is a mystery and confuses.&#39;, &#39;Ban&#39;: &#39;An act that is prohibited by social pressure or law.&#39;, &#39;Cars&#39;: &#39;Four-wheeled vehicles used for traveling.&#39;, &#39;Care&#39;: &#39;extra responsibility and attention.&#39;} {&#39;Absence&#39;: &#39;The lack or unavailability of something or someone.&#39;, &#39;Approval&#39;: &#39;Having a positive opinion of something or someone.&#39;, &#39;Answer&#39;: &#39;The response or receipt to a phone call, question, or letter.&#39;, &#39;Attention&#39;: &#39;Noticing or recognizing something of interest.&#39;, &#39;Amount&#39;: &#39;A mass or a collection of something.&#39;, &#39;Borrow&#39;: &#39;To take something with the intention of returning it after a period of time.&#39;, &#39;Baffle&#39;: &#39;An event or thing that is a mystery and confuses.&#39;, &#39;Ban&#39;: &#39;An act that is prohibited by social pressure or law.&#39;, &#39;Cars&#39;: &#39;Four-wheeled vehicles used for traveling.&#39;, &#39;Care&#39;: &#39;extra responsibility and attention.&#39;, &#39;Chip&#39;: &#39;Absence&#39;} .

            "content": "Ryan Hakimipour . Mrs. James . Hs English 3 . 26 August 2022 . How to be Happy . The two most contributing factors of happiness are meditation and resilience. Meditation is one of the most important factors in determining a person’s happiness. Do ever start to feel overwhelmed which ends up disrupting your happiness, if so I would highly recommend meditation. Wherever I start feeling that same way I start to feel less positive and less motivated into doing my daily tasks. This is when I start to realize that some things are off and this is when I start to give myself 10 minutes of my day to sit and relax and reflect on my day. This may seem odd but those 10 minutes help clear my mind and to reflect on my day and helps me relax. When that stress leaves my system it allows me to start thinking about myself which helps with my happiness. In addition, mediation helps with general happiness. Mediation can help with relieving stress and improving general happiness. When you practice daily meditation it can help reduce stress, quiet mental chatter, increase self-esteem, and much more. Less stress allows you to focus on yourself and increase happiness. Therefore it has been proven by many and by myself that meditation does help improve overall happiness. . Resilience is one of the most important factors in determining a person’s happiness. Have you ever just wanted to plow your way through any situation and hope for the best, that’s what resilience feels like. Being resilient helps people to be able to thrive during difficult times. Being resilient can also help ward off stress and move from depression to happiness. Being resilient is a choice and the right one at that since it helps increase happiness levels. Resilience is a key factor in being happy. But to be able to use resilience to its fullest potential you have to be able to decide between being resilient. In addition, I like to be resilient since I can make the best out of any situation. Being resilient is a choice so if you can make that choice it will allow you to fly through anything that tries to lower your happiness. Personally I like to always be open-minded no matter what and seek out the positive outcomes out of any situation such as when I visited Canada last summer our flight had gotten canceled right as we reached our gate. Though it did suck wasting about a couple of hours of our day we were able to see our family one more day before we left. All in all, being happy is a choice that only you can make. .",

            "content": "Ryan Hakimipour . Mr Yeung . APCSP . 29 August 2022 . Alumni . When we met with the Alumni of prior APCSP students earlier today they helped with my understanding of what the class has to offer and with opportunities that can help me later on in the future. Something that they had talked about was how there are a vast variety of majors that APCSP leads to. Coding can also be used in majors, apart from APCSP/APCSA. There can also be many difficulties when it comes to coding and many hardships that we have to face but you just have to keep pushing yourself and focus on yourself, and not worry about how the other “Steve Jobs”s of the world are doing. Many of these difficulties can be solved with a simple Google search since there have been others with the same problem as yourself. On the off chance that you can’t find an answer to a problem, don’t be afraid to reach out to others and ask for help. Another good tip is to prevent yourself from cutting corners and understand the code that you’re writing and try to expand on it. A good way to use your coding knowledge to the best of your ability is to try and get an internship which will not only help improve your skills but also boost your resume. It’s also good to have personal projects on the side so you can add them to your portfolio. Having something that you can apply to your work and a plan are great ways to keep yourself moving since it allows you to stay organized. .",
