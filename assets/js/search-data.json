Meditation is one of the most important factors in determining a person’s happiness. Do ever start to feel overwhelmed which ends up disrupting your happiness, if so I would highly recommend meditation. Wherever I start feeling that same way I start to feel less positive and less motivated into doing my daily tasks. This is when I start to realize that some things are off and this is when I start to give myself 10 minutes of my day to sit and relax and reflect on my day. This may seem odd but those 10 minutes help clear my mind and to reflect on my day and helps me relax. When that stress leaves my system it allows me to start thinking about myself which helps with my happiness. In addition, mediation helps with general happiness. Mediation can help with relieving stress and improving general happiness. When you practice daily meditation it can help reduce stress, quiet mental chatter, increase self-esteem, and much more. Less stress allows you to focus on yourself and increase happiness. Therefore it has been proven by many and by myself that meditation does help improve overall happiness. . Resilience is one of the most important factors in determining a person’s happiness. Have you ever just wanted to plow your way through any situation and hope for the best, that’s what resilience feels like. Being resilient helps people to be able to thrive during difficult times. Being resilient can also help ward off stress and move from depression to happiness. Being resilient is a choice and the right one at that since it helps increase happiness levels. Resilience is a key factor in being happy. But to be able to use resilience to its fullest potential you have to be able to decide between being resilient. In addition, I like to be resilient since I can make the best out of any situation. Being resilient is a choice so if you can make that choice it will allow you to fly through anything that tries to lower your happiness. Personally I like to always be open-minded no matter what and seek out the positive outcomes out of any situation such as when I visited Canada last summer our flight had gotten canceled right as we reached our gate. Though it did suck wasting about a couple of hours of our day we were able to see our family one more day before we left. All in all, being happy is a choice that only you can make. .",

            "content": "Ryan Hakimipour . Mr Yeung . APCSP . 29 August 2022 . Alumni . When we met with the Alumni of prior APCSP students earlier today they helped with my understanding of what the class has to offer and with opportunities that can help me later on in the future. Something that they had talked about was how there are a vast variety of majors that APCSP leads to. Coding can also be used in majors, apart from APCSP/APCSA. There can also be many difficulties when it comes to coding and many hardships that we have to face but you just have to keep pushing yourself and focus on yourself, and not worry about how the other “Steve Jobs”s of the world are doing. Many of these difficulties can be solved with a simple Google search since there have been others with the same problem as yourself. On the off chance that you can’t find an answer to a problem, don’t be afraid to reach out to others and ask for help. Another good tip is to prevent yourself from cutting corners and understand the code that you’re writing and try to expand on it. A good way to use your coding knowledge to the best of your ability is to try and get an internship which will not only help improve your skills but also boost your resume. It’s also good to have personal projects on the side so you can add them to your portfolio. Having something that you can apply to your work and a plan are great ways to keep yourself moving since it allows you to stay organized. .",
